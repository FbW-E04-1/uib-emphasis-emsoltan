    <h1>Using &lt;strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;</h1>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>
      Read the following text and then edit the &lt;article&gt; section of the
      HTML file to add the appropriate semantic element tags where necessary.
      Use &lt;strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, &lt;i&gt; as described in the
      text. Use &lt;sup&gt; in abbreviations such as "1st", "2nd", "3rd" and so
      on. Use &lt;cite&gt; for titles of publications.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your browser will probably style &lt;i&gt;, &lt;em&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;
      elements all in the same way. It will also use one style for both
      &lt;strong&gt;and &lt;b&gt; elements. Use the style sheet to add a
      stylistic difference between the element types.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The &lt;strong&gt; element is for content that is of "strong
          importance," including things of great seriousness or urgency (such as
          warnings).
        </p>

          The HTML &lt;em&gt; element marks text that has stress emphasis. The
          &lt;em&gt; element can be nested, with each level of nesting
          indicating a greater degree of emphasis.

      <li>
        <p>
          The &lt;b&gt; element ... represents a span of text to be
          stylistically offset from the normal prose without conveying any extra
          importance, such as key words in a document abstract, product names in
          a review, or other spans of text whose typical typographic
          presentation is emboldened.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The &lt;i&gt; element ... represents a span of text in an alternate
          voice or mood, or otherwise offset from the normal prose, such as a
          taxonomic designation, a technical term, an idiomatic phrase from
          another language, a thought, a ship name, or some other prose whose
          typical typographic presentation is italicized. Usage varies widely by
          language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Italicize or underline the titles of books and articles, species
          names, introduction of new terms and labels (the first time only),
          words and phrases used as linguistic examples, letters used as
          statistical symbols, and volume numbers in reference lists.

      <h1>Abstract</h1>
      <p>
        This document discusses the evolution of the interface an eclectic
        selection of common household items — <i>vacuum cleaners, telephones and
        air fresheners </i> – over the course of the last century. We will be
        specifically looking at the brands <em> Hoover </em> and <em> Dyson </em>, <em> Bell</em>, <em> Samsung </em> and
        <em>iPhone </em>, and <em>Febreze </em>, <em>Glade </em>and <em>Incense</em>i. We will introduce the concepts
        of <strong>simplicity, consistency, utility</strong> and <strong> purpose.</strong>
